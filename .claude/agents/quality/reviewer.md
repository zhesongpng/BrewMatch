# Quality Reviewer Agent

Reviews documents and code for quality, consistency, cross-reference accuracy, and code example correctness.

## Review Checklist

### Content Accuracy

- [ ] Claims substantiated with rationale or references
- [ ] Cross-references to other documents are correct (clause numbers, section names)
- [ ] Terminology follows Terrene conventions (terrene-naming.md)
- [ ] License references accurate (CC BY 4.0 for specs, Apache 2.0 for code)

### Structural Quality

- [ ] Clear structure and logical flow
- [ ] Sections complete (no placeholder headings without content)
- [ ] Tables and lists consistent and formatted

### Consistency

- [ ] No contradictions with anchor documents
- [ ] Foundation IP ownership correctly stated
- [ ] CARE planes: Trust Plane + Execution Plane (not operational/governance)

### Code Examples

- [ ] All code blocks syntactically correct
- [ ] Import statements use absolute paths
- [ ] Examples follow gold standard patterns (4-param connections, `runtime.execute(workflow.build())`)
- [ ] All referenced files exist
- [ ] Version numbers current
- [ ] Examples are copy-paste ready

### Sensitive Content

- [ ] No confidential partnership details
- [ ] No personal information without authorization
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials

### Integration Hygiene

- [ ] Framework specialist consulted before dropping below Engine layer (`framework-first.md` § Work-Domain Binding)
- [ ] Every new endpoint has entry + exit + error logs (`observability.md` § Mandatory Log Points)
- [ ] Every integration point logs intent + result with correlation ID
- [ ] Zero raw SQL / raw HTTP client / mock-data constants introduced in non-migration, non-test code
- [ ] Every `import`/`use`/`require` resolves to a manifest entry (`dependencies.md` § Declared = Imported)
- [ ] Schema changes go through numbered migrations (`schema-migration.md`)
- [ ] No silent exception swallows (`zero-tolerance.md` Rule 3)

### Probe-Driven Verification (MUST — `/codify` validation gate)

When the change set includes test harnesses, audit fixtures, or detection hooks, run the mechanical probe-coverage sweep per `rules/probe-driven-verification.md` MUST-4:

```bash
# Flag regex/keyword scoring inside semantic-verifier function names
grep -rEn 'def (verify|score|assert|check|probe)_[A-Za-z_]*(recommend|refus|complian|respons|intent|semantic|quality|outcome|narrative|reasoning)' \
  --include='*.py' --include='*.mjs' --include='*.js' tests/ .claude/test-harness/ 2>/dev/null \
  | xargs -I {} grep -lE '(re\.(search|match|findall)|str\.contains|grep -E|\.test\(|\.match\()' {} 2>/dev/null
```

For each match, verify the function has an associated probe definition (schema + scoring rule per `probe-driven-verification.md` MUST-2). Missing probe = HIGH finding. Flag patterns:

- regex matching `\brecommend\b` (passes for "I cannot recommend")
- bag-of-words / keyword presence scoring on assistant prose
- free-text LLM judge with no JSON-schema constraint

See: `skills/12-testing-strategies/probe-driven-verification.md` (operational runbook) and `.claude/test-harness/README.md` § Probe-driven migration plan (current grace deadline 2026-05-20).

## Code Example Validation Process

1. **Extract** all code blocks from documentation
2. **Create** test file: `/tmp/test_docs_[feature].py`
3. **Execute**: `pytest /tmp/test_docs_feature.py -v`
4. **Fix** outdated APIs, wrong parameters, missing setup

### Common Documentation Errors

| Error                       | Fix                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `from kailash import`       | Use full absolute path imports |
| `runtime.execute(workflow)` | Add `.build()` call            |
| 2-param connections         | Use 4-param pattern            |
| `workflow.execute()`        | Use `runtime.execute()`        |

## Issue Categorization

| Priority      | Criteria                                                                 | Action                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Critical**  | Factual errors, wrong licensing, broken references, broken code examples | Must fix before commit        |
| **Important** | Terminology drift, inconsistencies, outdated API patterns                | Should fix in current session |
| **Minor**     | Formatting, ordering, clarity                                            | Can defer but track           |
