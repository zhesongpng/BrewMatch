## Workspace Resolution

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies a project name, use `workspaces/$ARGUMENTS/`
2. Otherwise, use the most recently modified directory under `workspaces/` (excluding `instructions/`)
3. If no workspace exists, ask the user to create one first
4. Read all files in `workspaces/<project>/briefs/` for user context (this is the user's input surface)

## Phase Check

- Read `workspaces/<project>/04-validate/` to confirm validation passed
- Read `docs/` and `docs/00-authority/` for knowledge base
- Output: update existing agents and skills in their canonical locations (e.g., `agents/frameworks/`, `skills/01-core-sdk/`, `skills/02-dataflow/`, etc.)

## Execution Model

This phase executes under the **autonomous execution model** (see `rules/autonomous-execution.md`). Knowledge extraction and codification are autonomous — agents extract, structure, and validate knowledge without human intervention. The human reviews the codified output at the end (structural gate on what becomes institutional knowledge), but the extraction and synthesis process is fully autonomous.

## Workflow

### 1. Consume learning digest

Before extracting new knowledge, integrate what the learning system has captured:

1. Read `.claude/learning/learning-digest.json` — the structured summary of recent observations
2. Read `.claude/learning/learning-codified.json` — what was previously codified (avoid re-processing)
3. Read recent journal entries referenced in the digest (`decisions` array) — DECISION and DISCOVERY entries contain semantic context
4. Read `.session-notes` — latest session accomplishments and outstanding items

Analyze the digest for actionable findings:

- **Corrections** → Do any rules or skills need updating to match user preferences? Each correction is a real signal where the user pushed back on an approach.
- **Error patterns** → Should any recurring rule violations become new rule sections (DO/DO NOT with examples)?
- **Decisions** → Should any architectural decisions from journals become agent or skill knowledge?
- **Accomplishments** → Do any completed features need documentation in skills?

For each finding, either:

- Update an existing rule (add DO/DO NOT with example and Why)
- Update a skill's SKILL.md or sub-files
- Update an agent's knowledge section
- Skip (not worth codifying — explain why)

After processing, write `.claude/learning/learning-codified.json` to record what was analyzed:

```json
{
  "last_codified": "2026-04-07T12:00:00Z",
  "digest_hash": "<sha256 of digest at time of processing>",
  "actions_taken": [
    { "type": "rule_update", "file": "rules/patterns.md", "reason": "..." },
    {
      "type": "skill_update",
      "file": "skills/03-nexus/SKILL.md",
      "reason": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

This closes the feedback loop: observe → digest → **codify into real artifacts**.

### 2. Deep knowledge extraction

Using as many subagents as required, peruse `docs/`, especially `docs/00-authority/`, and `specs/` for domain specifications.

- Read beyond the docs into the intent of this project/product
- Read `specs/` to understand the detailed domain truth — specs contain the nuanced decisions, contracts, and constraints that should inform agent and skill updates
- Understand the roles and use of agents, skills, docs:
  - **Agents** — What to do, how to think about this, following procedural directives
  - **Skills** — Distilled knowledge for 100% situational awareness
  - **`docs/`** — Full knowledge base
  - **`specs/`** — Detailed domain specifications (authority on what the system does)

### 3. Update existing agents

Improve agents in their canonical locations.

- Reference `rules/cc-artifacts.md` for agent format (desc <120 chars, body <400 lines, frontmatter + trigger phrases); see `agents/frameworks/ml-specialist.md` as an example
- Identify which existing agent(s) should absorb the new knowledge
- If no existing agent covers the domain, create a new agent in the appropriate directory

### 4. Update existing skills

Improve skills in their canonical locations.

- Reference `.claude/guides/claude-code/06-the-skill-system.md` for skill format
- Update the directory's `SKILL.md` entry point to reference new files
- Skills must be detailed enough for agents to achieve situational awareness from them alone

### 5. Update README.md and documentation (MANDATORY)

Ensure user-facing documentation reflects new capabilities. Verify README.md, docstrings, and docs build.

### 6. Red team the agents and skills

Validate that generated agents and skills are correct, complete, and secure. **cc-architect** verifies cc-artifacts compliance (descriptions under 120 chars, agents under 400 lines, commands under 150 lines, rules path-scoped, SKILL.md progressive disclosure).

### 6b. Trust Posture Wiring (MANDATORY for new rules — ENFORCED)

Per `rules/trust-posture.md` MUST 7 + `skills/32-trust-posture/codify-integration.md`:

For each NEW rule authored in this codify cycle (grandfathered rules pre-dating the trust-posture system are exempt):

1. **Read** `.claude/learning/violations.jsonl` (last 30 days). Find self-reported / detected violations whose `addressed_by` is null AND whose root cause matches the candidate rule.
2. **Link** the rule to those violations: update `addressed_by: "rules/<file>.md@<sha>"` for each.
3. **Author** a "Trust Posture Wiring" section per `skills/32-trust-posture/rule-authoring-checklist.md` (severity, grace days, cumulative threshold, regression-within-grace policy, receipt requirement, detection mechanism, first-violation id, origin date).
4. **Append** to `.claude/learning/posture.json::pending_verification` (via `state-io.js::writePosture`) — never via direct Edit/Write (denied by `permissions.deny`).
5. **Verify** via cc-architect: every new rule file ends with `## Trust Posture Wiring`. Missing → audit FAIL → /codify halts and reports.

**ENFORCEMENT**: this step is FAIL-on-missing for any rule authored after `rules/trust-posture.md` was committed. cc-architect MUST grep each new rule file for the literal `## Trust Posture Wiring` header AND verify all 7 fields present in the section body (severity / grace / cumulative / regression-within-grace / receipt / detection / first-violation / origin). Missing or incomplete → audit FAIL → /codify halts.

The trust-posture rule itself is the only grandfather exception. Every other rule authored from this point forward MUST include the wiring section.

### 7. Create upstream proposal (BUILD repos) / 8. Upstream to atelier (loom only)

Follow the proposal protocol in `guides/co-setup/09-proposal-protocol.md`. Key rules:

- **BUILD repos** (kailash-py, kailash-rs): Create/append proposal at `.claude/.proposals/latest.yaml` for loom/ review. **Append, never overwrite** unprocessed proposals. See `rules/artifact-flow.md`.
- **loom/**: Propose CC/CO-tier artifacts upstream to atelier/ using the same append-not-overwrite protocol.
- **Downstream project repos**: SKIP. Changes stay local.

## Agent Teams

Deploy these agents as a team for codification:

**Knowledge extraction team:**

- **analyst** — Identify core patterns + distill requirements into reusable agent instructions
- `co-reference` skill — Ensure agents and skills follow COC five-layer architecture (codification IS Layer 5 evolution)

**Creation team:**

- **reviewer** — Validate skill examples are runnable + review agent/skill quality before finalizing

**Validation team (red team the agents and skills):**

- **cc-architect** — Verify cc-artifacts compliance: descriptions <120 chars, agents <400 lines, commands <150 lines, rules have `paths:` frontmatter, SKILL.md progressive disclosure, no CLAUDE.md duplication
- **gold-standards-validator** — Terrene naming, licensing accuracy, terminology standards
- **testing-specialist** — Verify code examples + probe-coverage on harness changes (`rules/probe-driven-verification.md` MUST-4)
- **security-reviewer** — Audit agents/skills for prompt injection, insecure patterns, secrets exposure

### Journal (MUST — phase-complete gate)

Before reporting `/codify` complete, create `/journal new <TYPE> <slug>` entries for: **DECISION** (which rules/skills/agents were updated and why), **DISCOVERY** (patterns extracted into institutional knowledge that the next session should inherit). Skip only if nothing is journal-worthy; do not batch.
