# /design - UI/UX Design Principles Quick Reference

## Purpose

Load the UI/UX Design Principles skill for framework-agnostic design patterns, layout principles, and enterprise UX guidelines.

**CRITICAL**: This skill should be invoked PROACTIVELY for ALL frontend work, regardless of framework (React, Flutter, etc.).

## Quick Reference

| Command              | Action                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `/design`            | Load comprehensive design principles              |
| `/design layout`     | Show layout and information architecture patterns |
| `/design hierarchy`  | Show visual hierarchy principles                  |
| `/design components` | Show component design guidelines                  |
| `/design responsive` | Show responsive design patterns                   |

## What You Get

- Top-Down Design Methodology (layout → features → components → details)
- Layout & Information Architecture (70/30 rule, grid systems)
- Visual Hierarchy Principles (F-pattern, Z-pattern, inverted pyramid)
- Enterprise UX Patterns (action hierarchy, search & filter, bulk actions)
- Component Design Guidelines (cards, buttons, empty states, loading states)
- Responsive Design Patterns (breakpoints, layout changes)
- Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Design System Principles (tokens, naming conventions)
- Common Pitfalls & Solutions

## Quick Principles

### Top-Down Design Order (ALWAYS Follow)

```
LEVEL 1: FRAME/LAYOUT (Highest Priority)
  → Space division, visual hierarchy, information architecture

LEVEL 2: FEATURE COMMUNICATION
  → Discoverability, action hierarchy, navigation

LEVEL 3: COMPONENT EFFECTIVENESS
  → Widget appropriateness, interaction patterns, feedback

LEVEL 4: VISUAL DETAILS (Lowest Priority)
  → Colors, shadows, animations, typography refinements
```

### The 70/30 Rule

- 70% of space = primary content (what user came to see/do)
- 30% of space = secondary UI (navigation, filters, chrome)

### Action Hierarchy

- **Primary**: 1 per page, large filled button, brand color
- **Secondary**: 2-3 per page, medium outlined button
- **Tertiary**: Unlimited, small text buttons, contextual

## Critical Rules

1. **ALWAYS** design top-down (layout before details)
2. **NEVER** perfect visual details before fixing layout
3. **ALWAYS** have visible primary CTA (not just keyboard shortcut)
4. **ALWAYS** test on all breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
5. **NEVER** use color as sole indicator (accessibility)
6. **ALWAYS** provide loading and empty states

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Load all design principles
/design

# Get layout patterns
/design layout

# Learn about visual hierarchy
/design hierarchy

# See component guidelines
/design components

# Get responsive patterns
/design responsive
```
