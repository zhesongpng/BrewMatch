## Workspace Resolution

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies a project name or todo, parse accordingly
2. Otherwise, use the most recently modified directory under `workspaces/` (excluding `instructions/`)
3. If no workspace exists, ask the user to create one first
4. Read all files in `workspaces/<project>/briefs/` for user context (this is the user's input surface)

## Phase Check

- Read files in `workspaces/<project>/todos/active/` to see what needs doing
- Read files in `workspaces/<project>/todos/completed/` to see what's done
- If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies a specific todo, focus on that one
- Otherwise, pick the next active todo
- Reference plans in `workspaces/<project>/02-plans/` for context
- If any file in `briefs/` was modified after `specs/_index.md`, STOP — briefs changed since analysis. Flag for user decision: re-run `/analyze` or acknowledge the brief change.

## Execution Model

This phase executes under the **autonomous execution model** (see `rules/autonomous-execution.md`). Implementation is fully autonomous — agents execute in parallel, self-validate through TDD, and converge through quality gates. The human observes outcomes but does not sit in the execution loop. Pre-existing failures are fixed, not reported (zero-tolerance). Agent-to-agent delegation (reviewer, security-reviewer) is autonomous, not human-gated.

## Workflow

### NOTE: Run `/implement` repeatedly until all todos/active have been moved to todos/completed

### 1. Prepare todos

You MUST always use the todo-manager to create detailed todos for EVERY SINGLE TODO in `todos/000-master.md`.

- Review with agents before implementation
- Ensure that both FE and BE detailed todos exist, if applicable

### 2. Context anchoring (MUST run before each todo)

Before implementing ANY todo, re-read the source material that spawned it:

1. **Re-read the relevant spec files** — check `specs/_index.md`, identify which spec files cover the domain of this todo, and read them. The spec is the authority on what to build. If the spec says `create_user(name, email, password_hash)`, that is the signature.
2. **Re-read the plan section** in `02-plans/` that this todo implements — not the whole directory, but the specific plan paragraphs. If the plan describes a `DataFabric` class with 3 methods, you are building that class with those 3 methods.
3. **Re-read relevant journals** in `workspaces/<project>/journal/` — decisions, trade-offs, and risks from analysis inform how to implement. If a journal says "chose event-driven over polling because of X," the implementation must be event-driven.
4. **Re-read the todo itself** — the description, not just the title. Todos have implementation details that get ignored when agents skim titles.
5. **Read current source code** before calling any existing service or function. Do not trust plans, specs, or previous todos for current method signatures — the code is the truth for what exists NOW. Specs are the truth for what SHOULD exist.

**Why this step exists**: Without it, agents implement from vague memory of what they think the todo means, not from what was actually specified. Plans describe 15 details; agents remember 3. The other 12 become mock data and missing features.

### 3. Implement

Continue with the implementation of the next todo/phase using a team of agents, following procedural directives.

- Ensure that both FE and BE are implemented, if applicable

### 4. Quality standards

Always involve tdd-implementer, testing-specialists, value auditor, ai ui ux specialists, with any agents relevant to the work at hand.

- Test for rigor, completeness, and quality of output from both value and technical user perspectives
- Pre-existing failures often hint that you are missing something obvious and critical
  - Always address pre-existing failures — do not pass until all failures, warnings, hints are resolved
- Always identify the root causes of issues, and implement optimal, elegant fixes

### 5. Testing requirements

Follow the **test-once protocol** from `rules/testing.md`: baseline ONCE before implementing, TDD cycle during red-green-refactor, regression check ONCE when todo complete, write `.test-results`. Bug fixes MUST include regression test marked `@pytest.mark.regression`.

### 6. LLM usage

When writing and testing agents, always utilize the LLM's capabilities instead of naive NLP approaches (keywords, regex, etc).

- Use ollama or openai (if ollama is too slow)
- Always check `.env` for api keys and model names to use in development

### 7. Spec-verify and close todos

Before moving ANY todo from `active/` to `completed/`, MUST:

1. **Re-read the plan section** that spawned this todo (same files from step 2)
2. **Check every detail** — not "does the file exist" but "does the implementation match what the plan specified, line by line"
3. **Check wiring** — if the todo involves UI, verify it calls real APIs (not mock/generated data). If it involves an architecture component, verify the designed abstraction exists (not ad-hoc replacements).
4. **Check journals** — if analysis journals flagged risks or constraints for this area, verify they were addressed
5. **Write verification record** — append a `## Verification` section to the todo file listing what was checked (plan reference, wiring status, journal constraints addressed)
6. **Update specs + deviation check** — if this todo changed domain truth, update the relevant spec file immediately (`rules/specs-authority.md` MUST Rule 5). If implementation deviates from spec, STOP: update spec with deviation and rationale, flag user-visible changes for approval before marking complete. **Only the orchestrator writes to `specs/`** — specialist agents report domain truth changes in their output; orchestrator applies them sequentially.

A todo is complete when the spec says X and the code does X. Not when the code does something and happens to compile.

### 8. Integration hygiene (end of each cycle)

Verify per `rules/observability.md`: new endpoints have logs, integration points have correlation IDs, zero raw SQL/mock data, log triage clean. The `integration-hygiene.js` hook catches most violations; this is the final pass. Update `docs/` at project root (essence and intent, not status).

## Agent Teams

Deploy these agents as a team for each implementation cycle:

**Core team (always):**

- **tdd-implementer** — Test-first development, red-green-refactor
- **testing-specialist** — 3-tier test strategy, Real infrastructure recommended in Tier 2-3
- **reviewer** — Code review after every file change (MANDATORY)
- **todo-manager** — Track progress, update todo status, verify completion with evidence

**Specialist (invoke ONE matching the current todo):**

- **pattern-expert** — Workflow patterns, node configuration
- **dataflow-specialist** — Database operations (if project uses DataFlow)
- **nexus-specialist** — API deployment (if project uses Nexus)
- **kaizen-specialist** — AI agents (if project uses Kaizen)
- **mcp-specialist** — MCP integration (if project uses MCP)

**Frontend team (when implementing frontend):**

- **uiux-designer** — Design system, visual hierarchy, AI interaction patterns
- **react-specialist** or **flutter-specialist** — Framework-specific implementation

**Recovery (invoke when builds break):**

- **build-fix** — Fix build/type errors with minimal changes (NO architectural changes)

**Quality gate (once per todo, before closing):**

- **value-auditor** — Evaluate from user/buyer perspective, not just technical assertions
- **security-reviewer** — Security audit before any commit (MANDATORY)

### Journal (MUST — phase-complete gate)

Before reporting each cycle complete, create journal entries for journal-worthy findings produced this cycle:

- **DECISION** — implementation choices made (architecture, library selection, design patterns)
- **DISCOVERY** — technical findings that surprised you or contradict prior assumptions
- **RISK** — potential issues discovered but not yet resolved

Use `/journal new <TYPE> <slug>` (or write directly to `workspaces/<project>/journal/NNNN-TYPE-slug.md`). Skip only when the cycle genuinely produced nothing journal-worthy — use judgment, not formulas. Do not batch: create each entry as you recognize it.
