# Worktree Isolation Rules

See `.claude/guides/rule-extracts/worktree-isolation.md` for extended examples, post-mortem prose, and session evidence for all 6 MUST rules.

Agents launched with `isolation: "worktree"` run in their own git worktree so parallel compile/test jobs do not fight over the same `target/` or `.venv/`. The isolation is only real if the agent actually edits files inside its assigned worktree path. When an agent drifts back to the main checkout — because the system prompt didn't pin cwd, because absolute paths were copied from the orchestrator, because the tool defaulted to `process.cwd()` — the isolation silently breaks.

This rule mandates a self-verification step at agent start AND a pre-flight check in the orchestrator's delegation prompt. The verification is cheap (one `git status`) and the failure mode is expensive (a whole session's worth of parallel work corrupted).

## MUST Rules

### 1. Orchestrator Prompts MUST Pin The Worktree Path

Any delegation that uses `isolation: "worktree"` MUST include the absolute worktree path in the prompt AND MUST instruct the agent to verify `git -C <worktree> status` at the start of its run. Passing the isolation flag without the explicit path is BLOCKED.

```python
# DO — explicit path + verification instruction
worktree = "/absolute/path/to/repo/.claude/worktrees/agent-shard-abc123"
Agent(isolation="worktree", prompt=f"""
Working directory: {worktree}
STEP 0 — verify: git -C {worktree} status
If branch mismatch, STOP and report "worktree isolation broken".
All file paths MUST be absolute and begin with {worktree}/.
""")

# DO NOT — isolation flag without pinned path
Agent(isolation="worktree", prompt="Implement feature X — use ml-specialist patterns.")
```

**BLOCKED rationalizations:** "The isolation flag handles the cwd for me" / "The tool sets up the worktree automatically" / "I'll just use relative paths, they're shorter" / "The agent will figure out the right directory" / "I tested it once, it worked — should keep working".

**Why:** The `isolation: "worktree"` flag creates the worktree but does not pin every tool call inside it — file-writing tools accepting absolute paths will write to the main checkout if the prompt uses a main-checkout path. One-line verification at agent start converts silent corruption into a loud refusal. See guide for 2026-04-19 post-mortem.

### 2. Specialist Agents MUST Self-Verify Cwd At Start

Every specialist agent file (`.claude/agents/**/*.md`) that may be launched with `isolation: "worktree"` MUST include a "Working Directory Self-Check" step at the top of its process section. The check prints the resolved cwd and the git branch, and refuses to proceed if either is unexpected.

```markdown
# DO — self-check baked into the agent file

## Step 0: Working Directory Self-Check

Before any file edit, run:
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
If top-level path does NOT match worktree path, STOP and emit
"worktree drift detected — refusing to edit main checkout".

# DO NOT — assume orchestrator pinned cwd
```

**Why:** The orchestrator's pinned-path instruction can be lost to context compression across long delegation chains; a self-check inside the specialist file is a belt-and-suspenders guarantee that survives prompt truncation. One git call (~30 ms) prevents specialist drift.

### 3. Parent MUST Verify Deliverables Exist After Agent Exit

When an agent reports completion of a file-writing task, the parent orchestrator MUST verify the claimed files exist at the worktree path via `ls` or `Read` before trusting the completion claim. Agent completion messages are NOT evidence of file creation.

```python
# DO — verify after agent returns
result = Agent(isolation="worktree", prompt=f"Write {worktree}/src/feature.py...")
assert_file_exists(f"{worktree}/src/feature.py")  # parent checks

# DO NOT — trust "done" and proceed
```

**BLOCKED rationalizations:** "The agent said 'done', that's good enough" / "Verifying every file slows the orchestrator" / "The agent would have errored if the write failed" / "Now let me write the file..." followed by no actual write.

**Why:** Agents hit budget mid-message and emit "Now let me write X..." without having written X. Kaizen round 6 and ml-specialist round 7 both reported success with zero files on disk. `ls` check is O(1) and converts silent no-op into loud retry.

### 4. Parallel-Launch Burst Size Limit (Waves of ≤3)

When launching multiple Opus agents with `isolation: "worktree"` in a single orchestration turn, the parent MUST launch them in waves of ≤3, NOT a single burst of 4+. Bursts of 4+ simultaneous Opus agents hit Anthropic server-side rate limiting and ALL fail at 30–45s elapsed. Rate-limit failures exit the agent before it commits anything.

```python
# DO — wave of 3, wait, then next wave
wave1 = [Agent(isolation="worktree", prompt="...") for _ in range(3)]
# wait for wave1 to complete before launching wave2

# DO NOT — burst of 6 simultaneous Opus worktree agents
for shard in [W31a, W31b, W31c, W32a, W32b, W32c]:
    Agent(isolation="worktree", prompt=f"... {shard} ...")
# ↑ all 6 rate-limited at 34-45s; zero commits; every shard's work lost.
```

**BLOCKED rationalizations:** "The API says we can launch as many as we want" / "Rate limits only kick in on sustained load" / "If any fail we'll just retry" / "Waves of 3 halves my throughput for no reason" / "The earlier tests with 4 agents worked fine".

**Why:** Empirically 4–6 concurrent Opus worktree agents from one parent exceeds server-side throttle; every agent in the burst dies before committing. Recovery is worse than serialization (re-launch + orphan recovery > waiting one wave). Evidence: 2026-04-23 M10 launch — 6 agents all died at 34–45s; waves of 3 completed cleanly. See guide for agent hashes.

### 5. Pre-Flight Merge-Base Check Before Worktree Launch

Before launching a worktree agent, the orchestrator MUST create the worktree's branch from the current `HEAD` of the feat/main branch the work will merge back into — NOT from a stale commit the agent happens to pick up. The orchestrator MUST verify `git merge-base <new-branch> <target-branch>` equals the CURRENT tip of `<target-branch>` at launch time. Launching without the merge-base check is BLOCKED.

```bash
# DO — pin the base SHA at launch, verify merge-base matches HEAD
target_head=$(git rev-parse feat/kailash-ml-1.0.0-m1-foundations)
git worktree add -b "feat/w31-core-ml-nodes" ".claude/worktrees/w31a" "$target_head"
merge_base=$(git merge-base "feat/w31-core-ml-nodes" feat/kailash-ml-1.0.0-m1-foundations)
[ "$merge_base" = "$target_head" ] || { echo "base drift — ABORT"; exit 1; }

# DO NOT — let the worktree default to a stale branch tip
git worktree add .claude/worktrees/w31a  # branches from whatever HEAD happens to be
```

**BLOCKED rationalizations:** "The worktree defaults handle the base SHA" / "Git will rebase at merge time" / "The packages don't overlap so stale base is fine" / "It worked this time, the failure mode is theoretical".

**Why:** `git worktree add` without explicit base defaults to whatever branch HEAD was last set — can be pre-merge commit from hours ago. Stale-base worktrees merge cleanly only when packages don't overlap; otherwise 3-way merge silently discards one shard's edits. Merge-base check converts invisible drift into loud pre-flight abort. Evidence: 2026-04-23 M10 launch — 5 of 6 worktrees branched from pre-W30-merge SHA. See guide.

### 6. Worktree Branch Name MUST Match Prompt's Declared Name

When the orchestrator prompt specifies a branch name (e.g. `feat/w31-core-ml-nodes`), the worktree MUST be created with that exact branch name — NOT the harness default `worktree-agent-<hash>`. The orchestrator MUST pass `-b <branch>` explicitly to `git worktree add`, AND the agent prompt MUST verify `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` matches the declared name before committing.

```python
# DO — explicit branch name on worktree creation
branch = "feat/w31-core-ml-nodes-observability"
subprocess.run(["git", "worktree", "add", "-b", branch, worktree, target_head])
Agent(isolation="worktree", prompt=f"""Branch: {branch}
STEP 0 — actual=$(git -C {worktree} rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
[ "$actual" = "{branch}" ] || exit 1""")

# DO NOT — let harness default assign worktree-agent-<hash>
Agent(isolation="worktree", prompt="Implement W31... use feat/w31-core-ml-nodes")
```

**BLOCKED rationalizations:** "The branch name is only for bookkeeping" / "Harness default names are fine, I'll rename at merge" / "The prompt mentions the name, the agent will set it" / "Hash-based names are more unique".

**Why:** Branch names are the primary `git log --grep` surface for tracing a shard back to its plan — `feat/w31-core-ml-nodes-observability` surfaces in history; `worktree-agent-aa7fb6a6` surfaces only as meaningless hash. Post-merge audits cannot enumerate "did every planned shard land?" via grep when half use harness defaults. Evidence: 2026-04-23 — 3 of 6 M10 shards got hash-default names; audit had to pull from working-memory table.

## MUST NOT

- Launch an agent with `isolation: "worktree"` without passing the absolute worktree path in the prompt

**Why:** The isolation flag alone does not guarantee every tool call stays inside the worktree — the prompt is the only place the agent learns where it belongs.

- Trust an agent's "completion" message when it says "Now let me write…" followed by no tool call

**Why:** Budget exhaustion truncates the write. The completion message is misleading; the filesystem is the source of truth.

- Use `process.cwd()` or relative paths inside specialist agent files that may run in a worktree

**Why:** `process.cwd()` resolves to whatever the Claude Code process was launched with (the main checkout), not the worktree; relative paths inherit the same problem.
