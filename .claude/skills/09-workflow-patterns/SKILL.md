# Kailash Workflows - Industry Patterns & Templates

Production-ready workflow patterns and templates for industry-specific use cases and common application patterns.

## When to Use

Use these patterns when asking about workflow examples, workflow templates, industry workflows, finance workflows, healthcare workflows, logistics workflows, manufacturing workflows, retail workflows, ETL workflows, RAG workflows, API workflows, document processing, business rules, or workflow patterns.

## Industry-Specific Patterns

| Industry      | File                                                                  | Key Use Cases                                                                      |

## Quick Patterns

### ETL Workflow

```python
workflow.add_node("Extract", "extract", {"source": "..."})
workflow.add_node("Transform", "transform", {"logic": "..."})
workflow.add_node("Load", "load", {"destination": "..."})
workflow.add_connection("extract", "data", "transform", "input")
workflow.add_connection("transform", "output", "load", "data")
```

### RAG Workflow

```python
workflow.add_node("Embed", "embed", {"model": "text-embedding-ada-002"})
workflow.add_node("Search", "search", {"index": "vectors"})
workflow.add_node("Generate", "generate", {"model": os.environ["LLM_MODEL"]})
```

### ML Training Workflow (W31a spec nodes)

```python
# Train → promote through registry tiers in one workflow (skill 34-kailash-ml is authority)
workflow.add_node("MLTrainingNode", "train", {"engine": "sklearn", "model_name": "churn", "task": "classification"})
workflow.add_node("MLRegistryPromoteNode", "promote", {"model_name": "churn", "tier": "staging"})
workflow.add_connection("train", "model_uri", "promote", "model_uri")
```

## Pattern Structure

Each sub-file includes: overview, architecture, nodes used, configuration, example code, best practices, testing strategies.

## CRITICAL Warnings

| Rule                      | Reason                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| NEVER hardcode secrets    | Use environment variables |
| ALWAYS validate inputs    | At workflow boundaries    |
| NEVER skip error handling | Required in production    |
