# Python Version Bump Playbook

When CPython ships a new stable release (~yearly, October), declare support across the SDK in three steps. Verified end-to-end on the 3.13 → 3.14 bump (PR #474, 2026-04-15).

## Trigger

A new CPython minor version has been stable on python.org for at least one release patch (3.X.0 → 3.X.1). Earlier than that, ML stack wheels (torch, transformers) typically aren't published yet.

## The 3-Step Recipe

### 1. Add the classifier to every `pyproject.toml`

Edit the trove classifier list in **all 10** package manifests (root + 9 sub-packages). Append `Python :: 3.X` after the highest existing version.

```toml
classifiers = [
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.13",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.14",   # <-- add this
]
```

Files (current as of 2026-04-15):

```
pyproject.toml
packages/kailash-dataflow/pyproject.toml
packages/kailash-nexus/pyproject.toml
packages/kailash-kaizen/pyproject.toml
packages/kailash-mcp/pyproject.toml
packages/kailash-pact/pyproject.toml
packages/kailash-trust/pyproject.toml
packages/kaizen-agents/pyproject.toml
packages/kailash-ml/pyproject.toml
packages/kailash-align/pyproject.toml
```

`requires-python = ">=3.11"` floor stays unchanged — we are widening declared support, not narrowing the minimum.

### 2. Add `"3.X"` to every per-version CI matrix

Four workflow files have `python-version` matrices that test multiple versions:

```
.github/workflows/unified-ci.yml          # core kailash matrix
.github/workflows/test-kailash-ml.yml     # ML stack matrix
.github/workflows/test-kailash-align.yml  # Align stack matrix
.github/workflows/trust-plane.yml         # trust plane × ubuntu/windows
```

Append `"3.X"` to each matrix array. **Do not** change single-version utility jobs (`publish-pypi.yml` builds wheels on 3.12 and that is correct — pure-Python wheels are forward-compatible).

### 3. Verify locally with `uv` BEFORE pushing

This catches missing wheels (especially in the ML stack) before CI burns time on it.

```bash
# Create a throwaway 3.X venv (uv auto-downloads the interpreter if needed)
uv venv --python 3.X /tmp/py3X-resolve

# Dry-run resolution per package — fails loudly if any wheel is missing for cp3X
for pkg in . packages/*/; do
  echo "=== $pkg ==="
  uv pip install --dry-run --python /tmp/py3X-resolve/bin/python "$pkg" 2>&1 | tail -3
done

# Confirm ML chain explicitly (highest-risk deps)
uv pip install --dry-run --python /tmp/py3X-resolve/bin/python packages/kailash-align \
  | grep -iE "^\s*\+ (torch|transformers|trl|accelerate|peft|datasets|polars|numpy|scikit-learn)"

# Optional: real install + smoke test of root kailash
uv pip install --python /tmp/py3X-resolve/bin/python .
/tmp/py3X-resolve/bin/python -c "import kailash; print(kailash.__version__)"

# Cleanup
rm -rf /tmp/py3X-resolve
```

If every package returns dependency lines (no `error:` or `No matching distribution`), 3.X is safe to declare.

## Common Gotchas

### Stale literal version assertions in test fixtures

Per-package version tests that hardcode the version string (e.g. `assert __version__ == "0.2.1"`) silently rot on every release bump and only surface when the matrix runs them. The 3.14 PR surfaced exactly this in `packages/kailash-align/tests/test_package.py` — the fixture had been red on `main` for two release bumps.

**Durable pattern** (no literal coupling to a specific version):

```python
import re

class TestVersion:
    _SEMVER_RE = re.compile(r"^\d+\.\d+\.\d+")

    def test_version_accessible(self):
        from mypkg._version import __version__
        assert self._SEMVER_RE.match(__version__), __version__

    def test_version_from_package(self):
        import mypkg
        from mypkg._version import __version__ as canonical
        assert mypkg.__version__ == canonical  # cross-surface contract
```

**Why:** Asserting a literal couples the test to a moving target. Asserting the contract (PEP 440 format AND `mypkg.__version__ == _version.__version__`) survives every release bump and would have caught the original drift that caused the staleness.

### Wheel build version

`publish-pypi.yml` hard-codes `python-version: "3.12"` for the wheel build job. Leave it alone unless the build itself needs newer syntax — pure-Python wheels (`Requires-Python: >=3.11`) install cleanly on 3.13 and 3.14 regardless of the build interpreter.

### ML stack wheel lag

`torch`, `transformers`, `accelerate` typically publish cp3X wheels 3-6 months after CPython 3.X.0 stable. If Step 3 shows missing wheels for any of those, do not add 3.X to the `kailash-ml` / `kailash-align` matrices — wait for upstream. The other 8 packages can still ship 3.X support.

PR #474 (2026-04-15) — first end-to-end execution of this recipe. Two commits:

- `44c00dc7` — classifier + matrix changes (15 files, +24 / -6)
- `bad6f505` — collateral fix for stale align version-test literal
