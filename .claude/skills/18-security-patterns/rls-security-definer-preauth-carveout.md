# RLS + SECURITY DEFINER Pre-Auth Carveout

Production-grade recipe for protecting principal tables (users, tenants, invites) with strict PostgreSQL RLS while preserving pre-auth read paths (login, password-reset, invite-accept). Lifted from an open-application reference implementation and generalized.

## When to use

- Principal tables containing PII or credentials (`users`, `tenants`, `invites`, `sessions`, `accounts`).
- The table MUST be readable pre-auth on at least one path (login lookup, password-reset lookup, invite-accept lookup).
- Your database has multiple roles (app, analytics, admin) and at least one role is not fully trusted for unscoped reads.
- You are NOT already behind a proxy that mediates every DB read with a per-user session.

## When NOT to use

- Post-auth-only tables (no bootstrap path) — strict RLS without carveout is sufficient.
- Service tables with no user context (settings, feature flags) — runtime predicate injection is sufficient.
- Single-role DB with trusted middleware — RLS adds operational cost without defence benefit.
- Development SQLite backends — SQLite has no RLS; use a test-equivalent assertion instead.

Standard login-timing-safe pattern: always execute `bcrypt_verify(candidate, dummy_hash)` before branching on helper result.    |
| **T8**  | **Cross-tenant read via `by_id` helper that returns but does not filter tenant_id** | **Multi-tenant helpers MUST accept `p_tenant_id` and filter by it in `WHERE`.** Without the filter, a caller with a valid session in tenant A who passes `p_id = <user_id_from_tenant_B>` gets tenant B's row back (SECURITY DEFINER bypasses RLS).

| **T9**  | **SECURITY DEFINER stickiness across nested calls**                                 | Helpers MUST NOT call back into non-SECURITY-DEFINER functions. Nested calls run under the SECURITY DEFINER's owner, silently elevating privilege for every callee. Keep helper bodies minimal + `LANGUAGE sql`.                                                                                                                                  |
| **T10** | **`CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` preserves GRANTs (privilege attack)**                | `CREATE OR REPLACE` preserves prior-version GRANTs. An attacker with `CREATE` on the schema can redefine the helper body while the `GRANT EXECUTE TO app_role` survives. Mitigation: `REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA <app_schema> FROM PUBLIC;` + schema owned by a superuser (not the app role); no role other than the owner gets `CREATE` on the schema. |

## MUST properties of a correct implementation

1. **Exactly N helpers for N pre-auth read paths.** Typical N = 2 or 3: `resolve_user_by_email` (login + password-reset), `resolve_user_by_id` (session refresh), `resolve_invite_by_token` (invite accept). Adding the (N+1)th helper requires a threat-review entry in the PR body. The pgTAP template below enforces `= N` exactly, not `<= 3`.
2. Each helper: `SECURITY DEFINER`, `SET search_path = <app_schema>, pg_temp`, `STABLE STRICT`, `LANGUAGE sql` (NOT `plpgsql` — stricter audit surface; see T6a / T9).
3. `REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION ... FROM PUBLIC;` followed by `GRANT EXECUTE ... TO <app_role>;` — nothing else.
4. Return columns: explicit list, minimum disclosure. Login needs `(id, password_hash, is_active)`; password-reset needs `(id, email, is_active)`; invite-accept needs `(id, email, invite_token_hash, invite_expires_at)`. Never `SELECT *`. The `by_email` / `by_id` asymmetry on `password_hash` is deliberate and load-bearing — see T5.
5. `COMMENT ON FUNCTION` citing the pre-auth path served. Reviewable by grep `pg_description`.
6. **Multi-tenant helpers MUST filter by `p_tenant_id`.** If the principal table has a `tenant_id` column, every helper that returns rows MUST accept `p_tenant_id` and include `AND tenant_id = p_tenant_id` in the `WHERE`. See T8.
7. **Caller MUST run a dummy bcrypt compare on 0-row results** to close the email-enumeration timing side-channel. See T7.
8. **pgTAP or pytest-asyncpg assertions MUST run in CI** against every migration that adds or modifies a helper or policy. A recipe without an enforcement gate is a suggestion, not a control.
9. **Trusted-middleware-only GUC contract.** `current_setting('app.user_id')` / `app.role` / `app.tenant_id` GUCs MUST be set by the middleware layer that owns authentication. User-supplied code paths (including anything reachable by `execute_raw` from an HTTP handler) MUST NOT be able to issue `SET app.role = 'service'` or equivalent. Enforce at the connection pool or session-wrapper layer.

## SQL recipe

Adapt for your schema (replace `app`, `app_role`, column lists). Tested on PostgreSQL 14+.

```sql
-- 0. Schema hardening (T10 — prevents CREATE OR REPLACE privilege preservation attack)
--    Schema SHOULD be owned by a superuser or dedicated owner role, NOT the app role.
REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA app FROM PUBLIC;

-- 1. Enable RLS on the principal table + force it even for table owner + strip PUBLIC
ALTER TABLE app.users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE app.users FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;         -- table-owner MUST also go through policy
REVOKE ALL ON TABLE app.users FROM PUBLIC;              -- multi-role DB: no ambient SELECT
-- NOTE: this recipe creates the SELECT policy only. If your app writes to users,
-- add parallel FOR INSERT / FOR UPDATE / FOR DELETE policies — RLS defaults to
-- no access once enabled, so writes will fail silently until you do.

-- 2. Strict role-aware scoped policy (replaces any USING(true))
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS users_scope_select ON app.users;
CREATE POLICY users_scope_select ON app.users
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    -- Self: authenticated user can read their own row
    id = current_setting('app.user_id', true)::bigint
    OR
    -- Admin: role-based elevation reads any row
    current_setting('app.role', true) = 'admin'
    OR
    -- Service-scoped: tenant-match for multi-tenant workers.
    -- SECURITY NOTE: app.role / app.tenant_id GUCs MUST be set by trusted
    -- middleware only. Any code path that can `SET app.role = 'service'`
    -- reads the full tenant. Enforce at the connection-pool or session layer.
    (current_setting('app.role', true) = 'service'
     AND tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)::bigint)
  );

-- 3. SECURITY DEFINER pre-auth read helper — login / password-reset lookup.
--    Multi-tenant: REQUIRES p_tenant_id. Single-tenant deployments: drop the
--    tenant argument AND the `AND tenant_id = p_tenant_id` predicate below.
--    Returns password_hash because the caller MUST bcrypt-compare it;
--    `by_id` (session refresh, step 4) MUST NOT return it.
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION app.resolve_user_by_email(p_email text, p_tenant_id bigint)
RETURNS TABLE (id bigint, email text, password_hash text, is_active boolean)
LANGUAGE sql

  SELECT id, email, password_hash, is_active
  FROM app.users
  WHERE email = p_email
    AND tenant_id = p_tenant_id
    AND is_active = true
  LIMIT 1;
$$;

COMMENT ON FUNCTION app.resolve_user_by_email(text, bigint) IS

REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION app.resolve_user_by_email(text, bigint) FROM PUBLIC;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION app.resolve_user_by_email(text, bigint) TO app_role;

-- 4. SECURITY DEFINER pre-auth read helper — session refresh by id.
--    REQUIRES p_tenant_id (T8 — without it, a valid session for tenant A
--    could session-refresh against a user_id from tenant B and get tenant B's row).
--    Does NOT return password_hash (T5 — session refresh has no compare surface).
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION app.resolve_user_by_id(p_id bigint, p_tenant_id bigint)

REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION app.resolve_user_by_id(bigint, bigint) FROM PUBLIC;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION app.resolve_user_by_id(bigint, bigint) TO app_role;

-- 5. Supporting index for pre-auth lookup performance (DoS-prevention at login rate).
--    NOT a security control; the predicate is table-scan without this.
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS users_tenant_email_active_idx
  ON app.users (tenant_id, email) WHERE is_active = true;
```

### Caller pattern (application side) — T7 timing-safe login

```python
# Python pseudocode — adapt for your stack
BCRYPT_DUMMY_HASH = "$2b$12$" + "0" * 53   # precomputed, never matches

def login(email: str, password: str, tenant_id: int) -> Optional[User]:
    row = db.fetch_one(
        "SELECT * FROM app.resolve_user_by_email($1, $2)",
        email, tenant_id,
    )
    if row is None:
        # T7: dummy compare so timing is constant regardless of user existence
        bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode(), BCRYPT_DUMMY_HASH.encode())
        return None
    if not bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode(), row["password_hash"].encode()):
        return None
    if not row["is_active"]:
        return None
    return User.from_row(row)
```

-- For this recipe N = 2 (resolve_user_by_email, resolve_user_by_id).

-- this test AND require an explicit bump of this constant in the same PR.

## Test template (pytest-asyncpg, for Python-side integration tests)

Requires: `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio>=0.21`, `asyncpg`. Consumer MUST provide a `postgres_url` fixture (e.g. in `tests/conftest.py`) pointing at a PostgreSQL 14+ instance with the migration applied. This template covers metadata checks AND the T8 cross-tenant regression behaviorally.

## Origin

Surfaced via consumer feedback in 2026-04 — lifted from an open-application reference migration (`0027_users_rls_policy.sql`) + companion SQL helpers (`0026c_sql_helpers.sql`) + bootstrap-blocker discovery journal. Generalized to a language-agnostic recipe so downstream COC-scaffolded projects can land the pattern without re-deriving the threat model. The SQL, threat model, and test templates are language-neutral; the caller-side T7 timing-safe login example is written in Python but translates directly to any binding — constant-time bcrypt comparison is the universal requirement.
