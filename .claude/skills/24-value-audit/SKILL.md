# Value Audit Skills

Enterprise demo QA methodology that goes beyond functional testing to evaluate whether a product tells a compelling, credible story to skeptical enterprise buyers.

## Core Concept

Traditional QA asks: "Does it work?"
Value Audit asks: "Does it sell?"

A product can pass every functional test and still fail a demo because:

- Pages show zero data (empty room problem)
- Features exist in isolation without connecting to the value story
- Metrics contradict the narrative (100% success with 0 completions)
- The transformation story (before → after) is missing

## The Five Questions

Every page, section, and element is interrogated with:

1. **What is this FOR?** — Business outcome, not feature description
2. **What does it LEAD TO?** — Connection in the value chain
3. **Why do I NEED this?** — What breaks if it doesn't exist
4. **How do I USE this?** — Path from viewing to getting value
5. **Where's the PROOF?** — Evidence it works, not promise it can
