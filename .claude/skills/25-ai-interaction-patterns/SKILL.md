# AI Interaction Patterns

AI-specific UX patterns for designing interfaces where users interact with AI models. Covers the full interaction lifecycle: from first prompt to output verification, memory persistence, and trust building.

**Source**: Based on [Shape of AI](https://www.shapeof.ai) pattern library (CC-BY-NC-SA) by Emily Campbell.

## When to Use

Use these patterns when asking about AI UX, AI interaction, prompt UX, AI trust, AI disclosure, AI avatar, AI personality, AI memory UX, action plan UX, stream of thought, AI citations, AI controls, AI wayfinding, AI suggestions, gallery pattern, follow-up pattern, draft mode, AI variations, AI consent, AI caveat, human-in-the-loop, AI transparency, AI state, prompt design, AI onboarding, or generative UI.

## How This Differs from Other UI/UX Skills

| Skill                                 | Focus                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **23-uiux-design-principles**         | Layout, hierarchy, responsive design (framework-agnostic)                         |
| **21-enterprise-ai-ux**               | Enterprise context: challenge taxonomy, professional palettes, RBAC               |
| **22-conversation-ux**                | Thread management, branching data model, context switching                        |

## Quick Pattern Selection

### By User Problem

| User Says/Feels                     | Apply Pattern                           |

### Trust Level Decision

```
High-stakes domain (healthcare, finance, legal)?
  YES -> CRITICAL: Citations + Verification + Disclosure + Caveat + Audit
  NO  -> AI output mixed with human content?
    YES -> HIGH: Disclosure + Citations + Caveat
    NO  -> Could AI output cause harm if wrong?
      YES -> MEDIUM: Caveat + Citations (optional)
      NO  -> LOW: Minimal caveat, focus on UX quality
```

## The Six Pattern Categories

### 1. Wayfinders — Help users construct their first prompt

Gallery, Suggestions, Templates, Follow-ups, Initial CTA, Nudges, Prompt Details, Randomize

### 2. Prompt Actions — Actions users direct AI to complete

Open Input, Inline Action, Chained Action, Regenerate, Transform, Restyle, Expand, Summary, Synthesis, Describe, Auto-fill, Restructure, Madlibs, Inpainting

### 3. Tuners — Adjust context and settings to refine prompts

Attachments, Connectors, Parameters, Model Management, Modes, Filters, Prompt Enhancer, Preset Styles, Saved Styles, Voice and Tone

### 4. Governors — Human-in-the-loop oversight and agency

Action Plan, Stream of Thought, Controls, Draft Mode, Branches, Variations, Citations, References, Verification, Memory, Cost Estimates, Sample Response, Shared Vision

### 5. Trust Builders — Confidence in AI ethics and accuracy

Disclosure, Caveat, Consent, Data Ownership, Watermark, Footprints, Incognito Mode

### 6. Identifiers — Distinct AI qualities at brand/model level

Avatar, Personality, Name, Color, Iconography

## CRITICAL Gotchas

| Rule                                                               | Why                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| NEVER use photorealistic avatars unless AI matches that capability | Sets unrealistic expectations, erodes trust            |
| ALWAYS show Stream of Thought for tasks > 5 seconds                | Users abandon when they can't see progress             |
| NEVER let Memory be a black box                                    | Users must see, edit, and delete what AI remembers     |
| ALWAYS offer Controls (at minimum: stop) during generation         | Users need escape hatches                              |
| NEVER rely solely on Caveats for safety                            | Caveat blindness is real; design the system to be safe |
| ALWAYS distinguish AI content from human content in blended UIs    | Users may unknowingly present AI work as their own     |
| NEVER overwrite user work without Verification                     | Accidental overwrites destroy trust instantly          |
