# COC Specification

**COC** = Cognitive Orchestration for Codegen. CO applied to software development — the first and most mature domain application.

## The Central Problem

Vibe coding works for prototypes but fails for production along three predictable fault lines:

| Fault Line             | Problem                                            | Root Cause                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Amnesia**            | AI forgets your instructions as context fills up   | Context window limits       |
| **Convention Drift**   | AI follows internet conventions instead of yours   | Training data overrides     |
| **Security Blindness** | AI takes the shortest path (never the secure path) | Optimization for directness |

**The root cause is not model capability. It is the absence of institutional knowledge surrounding the model.**

## The Value Hierarchy Inversion

```
Vibe Coding:  Better Model → Better Code → Competitive Advantage
COC Reality:  Better Context → Better Output → Competitive Advantage
              (specific to you)  (any model)    (defensible)
```

## Five-Layer Implementation for Codegen

### Layer 1: Intent — The Role

Route tasks to specialized expert agents (30+ agents across 7 development phases). Mirrors how effective engineering organizations work.

### Layer 2: Context — The Library

Progressive disclosure: CLAUDE.md → SKILL.md → Topic files → Full docs. 28+ skill directories. Framework-First (never code from scratch) + Single Source of Truth. This is **context engineering**, distinct from prompt engineering.

### Layer 3: Guardrails — The Supervisor

Rules (soft, AI interprets) + Hooks (hard, deterministic scripts outside model context). Anti-amnesia hook fires every message, survives context compression. Critical rules have 5-8 independent enforcement layers.

### Layer 4: Instructions — The Operating Procedures

Seven-phase workflow (analyze → plan → implement → test → deploy → release → final). Quality gates at 4 points. Evidence-based completion (file-and-line proof). Mandatory delegation (security review before every commit).

### Layer 5: Learning — The Performance Review

Observation-Digest-Codification pipeline. JSONL observation logs → digest-builder.js (pure aggregation into learning-digest.json) → /codify (LLM semantic analysis produces real artifacts). Human approves codified output at batch review gate.

## The Autonomous Execution Model

COC executes through autonomous AI agent systems, not human teams. Human-on-the-Loop: human defines operating envelope, agents execute within it.

**10x Throughput Multiplier**: Parallel execution (3-5x) + Continuous operation (2-3x) + Knowledge compounding (1.5-2x) - Validation overhead (0.7-0.8x) = ~10x net sustained.

**Structural gates** (human required): Plan approval, release authorization, envelope changes.
**Execution gates** (autonomous convergence): Analysis quality, implementation correctness, validation rigor, knowledge capture.

## CARE → COC Mapping

| CARE/EATP Concept   | COC Equivalent            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Trust Plane         | Rules + CLAUDE.md         |
| Execution Plane     | Agents + Skills           |
| Genesis Record      | `session-start.js`        |
| Trust Lineage Chain | Mandatory review gates    |
| Audit Anchors       | Hook enforcement          |
| Operating Envelope  | Rule files + hook scripts |

## Honest Limitations

- Novel architecture decisions (no established pattern to follow)
- Distributed systems complexity (emergent problems beyond local guardrails)
- Model-specific limitations (reduced, not eliminated)
- Legacy codebases (fewer frameworks to compose with)
- Greenfield domains (~2-3x first session, not 10x)

## Implementation

For the COC template implementation, see [28-coc-reference/](../28-coc-reference/SKILL.md) and the Kailash COC template repos.
