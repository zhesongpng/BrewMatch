# Spec Compliance Audit

**File existence is NOT compliance.** A file `wrapper_base.py` may exist while none of the spec-required classes inside it do. This skill defines how to verify spec compliance via direct code inspection — AST parsing and targeted greps — instead of trusting that a file at the right path means the right content is there.

## When to Use

- `/redteam` Step 1 — primary use, every round
- `/codify` validation gate before knowledge capture
- Any "is the plan implemented?" question

## The Failure Mode This Prevents

A previous BUILD repo run reported "39/39 PASS, 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH" via a `convergence-verify.py` script. A follow-up deep audit found 27+ CRITICAL findings:

- `StreamingAgent.run_stream()` was a fake stream — yielded one synthetic `TextDelta` from a single inner `run_async()` call
- `BaseAgentConfig.posture` field didn't exist (grep returned 0 hits in entire `kaizen/core/`)
- `@deprecated` decorator was defined in `deprecation.py` but never imported by `base_agent.py`
- `client.py` was COPIED, not MOVED — both source and destination existed at full size, drifting apart
- New wrapper modules had ZERO test coverage (`grep "from kaizen_agents.wrapper_base" tests/` returned empty)
- Spec § Security Threats subsections existed only in spec text — no `test_<threat>` functions

The convergence script existed but it was an existence checker (`(path / "__init__.py").exists()`), not a compliance checker. The audit must NOT rely on self-reports written by previous rounds.

## The Method: Spec → Acceptance Assertions → AST/Grep

For each spec section, write down a literal acceptance assertion table, then verify each row against the actual code. Re-derive every check from scratch each round.

### Step 1: Extract Acceptance Assertions From Spec

Read the spec text verbatim. For each promised artifact, write the literal assertion:

| Spec promise                                                                 | Acceptance assertion                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "`StreamingAgent.run_stream()` yields `TextDelta` tokens incrementally"      | grep `def run_stream` in src; AST: must yield ≥2 distinct values across the loop, NOT a single yield from a single `inner.run_async()` call |
| "`BaseAgentConfig` has frozen field `posture: Posture`"                      | grep `posture:` in `BaseAgentConfig` dataclass body                                                                                         |
| "`@deprecated` decorator applied to 7 extension points"                      | grep `@deprecated` in `base_agent.py` — must hit ≥7 distinct methods                                                                        |
| "MOVE `client.py` from `src/kailash/mcp_server/` to `packages/kailash-mcp/`" | source must be deleted OR <50 LOC OR import-and-warn shim                                                                                   |

### Step 2: Run The 9 Verification Checks

For every spec section, MUST perform every applicable check:

#### 1. Class Signature Verification

Grep the class definition AND verify the constructor signature matches the spec (parameter names + defaults). Use `ast.parse` for precision.

```python
import ast
src = open("src/kaizen/streaming/agent.py").read()
tree = ast.parse(src)
for node in ast.walk(tree):
    if isinstance(node, ast.ClassDef) and node.name == "StreamingAgent":
        init = next((n for n in node.body if isinstance(n, ast.FunctionDef) and n.name == "__init__"), None)
        params = [a.arg for a in (init.args.args if init else [])]
        kwonly = [a.arg for a in (init.args.kwonlyargs if init else [])]
        # Spec: StreamingAgent(inner: BaseAgent, *, buffer_size: int = 64)
        assert params == ["self", "inner"], f"signature mismatch: {params}"
        assert "buffer_size" in kwonly, f"missing keyword-only arg buffer_size"
```

**Grep fallback (less precise):**

```bash
grep -A 5 "^class StreamingAgent" src/kaizen/streaming/agent.py | grep "def __init__"
```

> **Cross-SDK note**: This skill is Python-only because it syncs to USE templates that serve Python and Ruby developers. The kailash-rs BUILD repo (the only place where non-Python source is edited) maintains its OWN equivalent verification protocol locally at `.claude/skills/spec-compliance/rust-parity.md`, which loom never overwrites. Do NOT add non-Python examples to this global skill.

#### 2. Field Presence Verification

For each spec-promised dataclass field, grep the file. Empty grep = FAIL.

```bash
# Spec: BaseAgentConfig has frozen field `posture: Posture`
grep -n "posture:" src/kaizen/agents/base_agent.py | grep -v "^#"
# Zero hits → CRITICAL: BaseAgentConfig.posture missing
```

`ast.parse` is more reliable than grep when fields span multiple lines or have inline comments.

#### 3. Decorator Application Verification

A `@deprecated` decorator existing in `deprecation.py` is NOT enough. Grep the actual call site:

```bash
grep -c "@deprecated\|deprecated(" src/kaizen/agents/base_agent.py
# Spec requires 7 application sites → grep returns 0 → CRITICAL
```

The count must match the spec count, NOT just be ≥ 1. "7 methods marked deprecated" means exactly 7 `@deprecated` lines, not "at least one".

#### 4. MOVE Shim Verification

For every "MOVE A → B" task, the source path A MUST satisfy ONE of:

- (a) deleted entirely
- (b) <50 LOC (a thin shim)
- (c) imports from B AND emits `DeprecationWarning`

```bash
wc -l src/kailash/mcp_server/client.py packages/kailash-mcp/src/kailash_mcp/client.py
# Both 1088 lines → CRITICAL: copied not moved (drift risk)

# If source is a thin shim, verify it imports from new path AND warns:
grep -E "from kailash_mcp.client import|warnings.warn.*Deprecat" src/kailash/mcp_server/client.py
```

#### 5. New Test Coverage Verification

For every new module the spec creates, grep the test directory for an import of that module. Zero importing tests = HIGH finding regardless of "tests pass".

```bash
grep -rln "from kaizen_agents.wrapper_base\|import wrapper_base" packages/kaizen-agents/tests/
# Empty → HIGH: new module has zero test coverage
```

Use `pytest --collect-only -q` to enumerate the test suite when spot-checking is insufficient.

#### 6. Security Mitigation Test Verification

For every § Security Threats subsection in any spec, grep for a corresponding `test_<threat>` function. Missing = HIGH.

```bash
# Spec § Threat: prompt injection via tool description
grep -rln "test.*prompt.*injection\|test.*tool.*description.*injection" tests/
# Empty → HIGH: documented threat has no test
```

#### 7. Import Migration Verification

For every "consumer X migrates to import from Y" task, grep the consumer file for the OLD import path. Hits = FAIL (migration didn't happen).

```bash
grep -rn "from kailash_mcp.client\|import kailash_mcp.client" packages/kaizen-agents/src/
# Any hits → FAIL: migration incomplete
```

#### 8. Fake-Implementation Pattern Scan

Scan for streaming/async methods that fake their contract — methods that promise incremental tokens but yield once:

```bash
# Find run_stream/stream_* methods
grep -rn "def run_stream\|async def stream_" src/

# For each match, count yields in the function body
grep -A 30 "def run_stream" src/kaizen/streaming/agent.py | grep -c "yield"
# Spec says incremental tokens → 1 yield per method → "fake stream" CRITICAL
```

Other fake patterns to scan for:

- `async def` methods that don't `await` anything (synchronous wearing async clothes)
- `__aiter__` returning `self` and `__anext__` raising `StopAsyncIteration` immediately
- Tool methods that return hardcoded responses regardless of input

#### 9. Self-Report Trust Ban

NEVER trust files written by previous rounds:

- `.spec-coverage` (file-existence checker output)
- `.test-results` (may report old-code coverage while new code has zero tests)
- `convergence-verify.py` (often written to make the red team pass, not to test compliance)

Re-derive every check from scratch on every audit round. Self-reports created during a previous /implement or /redteam are inputs to be verified, not evidence to be trusted.

## Output Format

For every spec section produce an assertion table:

| Assertion                              | Method | Expected | Actual | Status   |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- | ------ | -------- |
| `BaseAgentConfig.posture` field exists | grep   | ≥1       | 0      | CRITICAL |
| `@deprecated` on 7 extension methods   | grep   | 7        | 0      | CRITICAL |
| `StreamingAgent.run_stream` yields ≥2  | AST    | ≥2       | 1      | CRITICAL |
| `client.py` source deleted or thin     | wc -l  | <50      | 1088   | CRITICAL |

Save to `workspaces/<project>/.spec-coverage-v2.md` (the `-v2` suffix prevents confusion with the legacy file-existence report). Include the literal grep/AST commands so the next round can re-run them.

## Convergence Requirement

`/redteam` cannot converge until:

1. Every spec section has its assertion table.
2. Every assertion shows a real verification method (`grep …`, `ast.parse(…)`, `wc -l …`, `pytest --collect-only …`).
3. No row says "exists: yes" — that is a banned phrase. Rows must show the literal command and its actual output count.
4. Every CRITICAL/HIGH row has been fixed and re-verified, not deferred.

## Anti-Patterns

**BLOCKED audit behaviors:**

- Reading `.spec-coverage` from a previous round and trusting it
- Running a script written by a previous round and trusting its output
- Reporting "39/39 PASS" without showing the 39 acceptance assertions
- Using `(path / "__init__.py").exists()` as a compliance check
- Trusting `.test-results` to verify new modules have tests
- Calling a row "exists: yes" without a grep or AST proof
- Skipping checks 5-7 because "the suite passes"
